# U-Net for Yeast Cell Segmentation

Computerized cell segmentation is a common task in the life sciences. It is a classification problem where the inputis a  microscope image of a group of cells, and the output is a  matrix of  integers that indicates which pixels belong inside and  outside of a cell. Pixels can also be labeled to indicateprecisely which cell they represent. Because of the tremendous variance in cell morphology, segmentation is a difficult problem,even when one considers only a single type of cell. We present a fully convolutional neural network based on U-Net that can correctly segment an image of a yeast cell colonies.

In our work, we evaluated U-net in yeast cell segmentation. We collaborated with Professor Sahand Jamal Rahi from  theLaboratory of the Physics of Biological Systems at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

This project was created as a part of Machine Learning (CS-433) class at EPFL during Autumn semester 2019 with Martin Hanzel and Rastislav Kováč.
